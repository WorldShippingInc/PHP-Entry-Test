# PHP-Entry-Test
### This is the junior developer test in PHP, HTML, and CSS for World Shipping, Inc.

There are different ways to test your PHP online using a php sandbox which will give you the html code you can save and open in a browser, or there is a way to set up ISS on your computer to display the code. 

*PHP and HTML*

	1. Fill in your name and the date in the "By" line.
	2. In the first text box, labeled "Current Date and Time", display the date and time that the page loaded. Make the date in Month/Day/Year formatting and the time in Hour:Minutes:Seconds formatting.
	3. Disable modifying the date and time in the first text box, labeled "Current Date and Time". 
	4. Fill in the drop down, labeled "Favorite Programming Language", with the $programmingLanguages array.
	
*CSS*

	For the CSS portion, getting the basics is the most important which will be listed below, however if you consider yourself a web designer and want to do more than the list, please do.  

	1. Center all items in the body (inputs, labels and headers) horizontally.
	2. The background needs to be or contain a dark blue.
	3. The top 2 headers need to be white
	4. The labels for inputs and the footer need to be a red or pink
